# Unsupervised-Learning-in-Iris-Dataset
Objective:
The objective of this  evaluate your understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset
Use the Iris dataset available in the sklearn library.
1. Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation 
1. KMeans Clustering 
   KMeans is a popular clustering algorithm that divides a dataset into k clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and the cluster's centroid.
   The Iris dataset is well-suited for KMeans because it has relatively well-separated clusters based on species.
   Output:
Scatter Plot: The scatter plot will show the clusters formed by KMeans based on two features of the Iris dataset.
Cluster Centers: The output will print the centroids of the three clusters formed by the algorithm.
3. Hierarchical Clustering 
   Starts with each data point as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters until all points are grouped into a single cluster.
   Starts with each data point as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters until all points are grouped into a single cluster.
   For datasets with few data points and clear structure, like Iris, hierarchical clustering can capture meaningful relationships between data points.
   Output:
Dendrogram: Visualizes the hierarchical structure of clusters.
Scatter Plot: Displays the clusters after applying hierarchical clustering.
